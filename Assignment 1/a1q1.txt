(a) This is a violation. The policy forbids copying another student’s work. In this situation, both parties
violated the policy.
(b) This is a violation. The policy forbids copying another student’s work, with or without their knowledge,
however, in this situation, only the person doing the copying violated the policy.
(c) This is a violation. These students worked together to produce a single solution which they all
copied. This amounts to working as a group, which is not permitted unless explicitly allowed by
the instructor.
(d) This is a violation. Misty helped Brock to such an extent that the work that Brock handed in was
not his own. Both Misty and Brock are in violation of the policy here.
(e) This is not a violation. Jessie and James did not substantially contribute to Meowth’s solution but
merely helped him past a roadblock. In general helping someone x an error in their program
when they get stuck is ne, as long as you are not helping them re-write more than a few lines of
their program. The policy explicitly allows students to seek assistance in xing small errors from
fellow students.
(f) This is not a violation. Mewtwo and Lucario did not exchange any recorded information. They
came up with a solution together but destroyed their collaborative work. Since they were both
able to re-create their solutions on their own, their solutions are their own work. They are not
in danger of getting accused of copying because their re-created solutions would not resemble
each other closely enough.
